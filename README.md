## Minimum Requirements ##
- OS that allows compilation of C++ programs
- Compiler

## Tools ##
- GDB debugger
- Valgrind
- Gcc compiler
- Gedit

## Features ##
- Create a simulation of a telephone company. This program allows us to store a collection of subscribers, in which, stores a collection of incoming and outgoing calls to and from the subscriber. With this information, we are able to compute a specified subscriber's most frequent caller, who the subscriber has called most frequently, and print out a history of incoming and outgoing calls for the telephone company. We are also able to manipulate these collection classes when a new subscriber is added, or a phone call is made. The program will begin by displaying a menu to:
  - **(1)**: Compute the most frequent caller to a specified subscriber of the telephone company.
  - **(2)**: Compute the most frequent called number for a specified subscriber of the telephone company.
  - **(3)**: Print out the history of all calls made by all subscribers registered in the telephone company
  - **(0)**: Exit the program.

## Compiling Instructions ##
- **(1)**: Download all files included in this repository.
- **(2)**: Open the terminal and _cd_ into the proper directory.
- **(3)**: Type '_make_' into the terminal and wait for the compiler to compile.
- **(4)**: Run the executable '_p2_' by doing '_./p2_' in the terminal. The menu should now appear. 
- **(5)**: Specify what you would like to calculate by entering the number assoicated with the command.
- **PS**: Type '_make clean_' in the terminal to remove all object files.
